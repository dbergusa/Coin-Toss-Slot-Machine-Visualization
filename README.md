# Coin Toss Slot Machine Visualization

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A user interface that visually depicts coin tosses in a slot machine format, developed in a unique partnership with Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 to explore AI-assisted development and teach an AI about human perception.

## Description

This project, created and maintained by **David Berg**, is more than just a visual application; it's an experiment in human-AI collaboration. The entire user interface, from the HTML structure to the CSS animations and JavaScript logic, was generated by **Google AI Studio (Gemini Pro 2.5)** under human guidance.

The development process was iterative: Gemini was given a task, and then educated step-by-step on best practices, user experience principles, and the nuances of how humans perceive visual information. This project serves as a case study in teaching an AI to not just write code, but to understand the *why* behind design choices, resulting in a fun, human-friendly interface.

## Features

*   **Interactive Slot Machine:** A visually appealing slot machine interface to display coin toss results.
*   **Dynamic Animations:** Smooth and engaging animations for the "spinning" reels (coin tosses).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive controls, designed with human perception in mind.

## Development Methodology

The core of this project is its unique development process. Instead of being coded traditionally, it was built using a conversational, educational approach with an AI:

*   **AI as a Development Partner:** Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 was used as the primary code generator.
*   **Iterative Instruction:** The process involved providing prompts and receiving code snippets.
*   **Human-Centric Feedback:** Crucially, feedback was provided to the AI after each step, explaining *why* certain changes were needed to better appeal to human users (e.g., timing of animations, color choices, layout). This "taught" the AI about UI/UX best practices in a practical context.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML5
    *   CSS3
    *   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **AI Partner:**
    *   [Google AI Studio (Gemini Pro 2.5)](https://aistudio.google.com/)
